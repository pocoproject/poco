POCO C++ Libraries Windows CE Platform Notes
AAAIntroduction

!!!Introduction

Starting with release 1.4.0 the POCO C++ Libraries cannot be used on Windows CE
platform anymore. The reason for this is that POCO has moved to support C++17.
Windows CE does not support C++17 anymore. Also as C++17 needs Visual Studio
2017 it also does not support Windows CE anymore.
