AAAIntroduction

!!!Release 1.3.6

!!Summary of Changes

  - added Environment::processorCount()
  - added POCO_VERSION macro to Poco/Foundation.h
  - fixed SF# 2807527: Poco::Timer bug for long startInterval/periodic interval
  - fixed a bug similar to SF# 2807527 in Poco::Util::Timer.
  - fixed SF# 2795395: Constructor doesn't treat the params "key" and "iv"
  - fixed SF# 2804457: DateTime::checkLimit looks wrong
  - fixed SF# 2804546: DateTimeParser requires explicit RFC1123 format
  - added ReleaseArrayPolicy to Poco::SharedPtr
  - upgraded to SQLite 3.6.20
  - fixed SF# 2782709: Missing semicolons in "Logger.h" convenience
  - fixed SF# 2526407: DefaultStrategy.h ++it instead of it++ in a loop
  - fixed SF# 2502235: Poco STLPort patch
  - fixed SF# 2186643: Data::Statement::reset() not implemented in 1.3.3
  - fixed SF# 2164227: Allow File opened read only by FileInputSteam to be writable
  - fixed SF# 2791934: use of char_traits::copy in BufferedStreamBuf::underflow
  - fixed SF# 2807750: Support additional SQL types in SQLite
  - fixed documentation bugs in Timed/PriorityNotificationQueue
  - fixed SF# 2828401: Deadlock in SocketReactor/NotificationCenter (also fixes patch# 1956490)
    NotificationCenter now uses a std::vector internally instead of a std::list, and the mutex is
    no longer held while notifications are sent to observers.
  - fixed SF# 2835206: File_WIN32 not checking aganist INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE
  - fixed SF# 2841812: Posix ThreadImpl::sleepImpl throws exceptions on EINTR
  - fixed SF# 2839579: simple DoS for SSL TCPServer, HTTPS server
    No SSL handshake is performed during accept() - the handshake is delayed until
    sendBytes(), receiveBytes() or completeHandshake() is called for the first time.
    This also allows for better handshake and certificate validation when using
    nonblocking connections.
  - fixed SF# 2836049: Possible handle leak in FileStream
    If sync() fails, close() now simply set's the stream's bad bit.
    In any case, close() closes the file handle/descriptor.   
  - fixed SF# 2814451: NetSSL: receiveBytes crashes if socket is closed
  - added a workaround for Vista service network initialization issue
    (an Windows service using the Net library running under Vista will
    crash in the call to WSAStartup() done in NetworkInitializer).
    Workaround is to call WSAStartup() in the application's main().
    Automatic call to WSAStartup() in the Net library can now be disabled 
    by compiling Net with -DPOCO_NET_NO_AUTOMATIC_WSASTARTUP. Also
    the new Poco::Net::initializeNetwork() and Poco::Net::uninitializeNetwork()
    functions can be used to call WSAStartup() and WSACleanup(), respectively,
    in a platform-independent way (on platforms other than Windows, these
    functions will simply do nothing).
  - added VCexpress build script support (contributed by Jolyon Wright)
  - fixed SF# 2851052: Poco::DirectoryIterator copy constructor is broken
  - fixed SF# 2851197: IPAddress ctor throw keyword missing
  - added Poco::ProtocolException
  - PageCompiler improvements: new tags, support for buffered output, etc.
  - better error reporting in Data MySQL connector (patch #2881270 by Jan "HanzZ" Kaluza)
  - fixed SF# 1892462: FTPClient:Choose explicitely between EPSV and PASV
  - fixed SF# 2806365: Option for PageCompiler to write output to different dir 
  - fixed a documentation bug (wrong sample code) in Process::launch() documentation
  - added --header-output-dir option to PageCompiler
  - fixed SF# 2849144: Zip::Decompress notifications error
  - SAXParser has a new feature: "http://www.appinf.com/features/enable-partial-reads".
    See ParserEngine::setEnablePartialReads() for a description of what this does.
  - fixed SF# 2876179: MySQL Signed/Unsigned value bug
  - fixed SF# 2877970: possible bug in timer task
  - fixed SF# 2874104: wrong parsing empty http headers
  - fixed SF# 2860694: Incorrect return code from SecureStreamSocketImpl::sendBytes
  - fixed SF# 2849750: Possible bug with XMLWriter?
  - added MailMessage::encodeWord() to support RFC 2047 word encoded
    mail header fields when sending out mail containing non-ASCII
    characters.
  - fixed SF# 2890975: SMTPClientSession bug with 7BIT encoding
  - fixed an issue with retrieving the value of socket options on Windows 7. 
    Before obtaining the value of a socket, we now initialize the variable receiving the 
    socket option value to zero.
  - fixed SF# 2836141: Documentation errors
  - fixed SF# 2864232: Socket::select() does not detect closed sockets on windows
  - fixed SF# 2812143: Socket::select() should check socket descriptors...
  - fixed SF# 2801750: NetworkInterface <iface-Obj>forName returns wrong subnetMask
  - fixed SF# 2816315: Problem with POSIX Thread::sleepImpl
  - fixed SF# 2795646: IPv6 address parsing bug
  - fixed #0000092: ServerApplication::waitForTerminationRequest(), SIGINT and GDB.
    Poco::Util::ServerApplication::waitForTerminationRequest() no longer registers a
    signal handler for SIGINT if the environment variable POCO_ENABLE_DEBUGGER
    is defined.
  - fixed SF# 2896070: Poco::Net::Context with non-ASCII paths
  - added Unicode Surrogate support to Poco::UTF16Encoding. 
    See Poco::TextEncoding::queryConvert() and Poco::TextEncoding::sequenceLength() 
    for how this is implemented. Contributed by Philippe Cuvillier.
  - fixed SF# 2897650: [branch 1.3.6] Net.SocketAddress won't compile for CYGWIN
  - fixed SF# 2896161: Building on Windows fails when basedir has space in it
  - fixed SF# 2864380: Memory leak when using secure sockets
  - NetSSL_OpenSSL: the SSL/TLS session cache is now disabled by default and
    can be enabled per Context using Poco::Net::Context::enableSessionCache().
  - fixed SF# 2899039: Wrong DST handling in LocalDateTime 
  - added Poco::RWLock::ScopedReadLock and Poco::RWLock::ScopedWriteLock (contributed by Marc Chevrier)
  - added Poco::Thread::TID type, as well as Poco::Thread::tid() and Poco::Thread::currentTid() 
    to obtain the native thread handle/ID
  - added Zip file comment support
  - On Windows, Poco::SharedLibrary::load() now uses LoadLibraryEx instead of LoadLibrary
    and uses the LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH if an absolute path is specified. This will
    add the directory containing the library to the search path for DLLs that the
    loaded library depends upon.
 

!!!Release 1.3.5

!!Summary of Changes

  - fixed SF# 2779410: Poco::Data::ODBC::HandleException impovement
  - fixed wrong exception text for Poco::UnhandledException
  - Fixed a problem with SSL shutdown that causes clients (web browsers) 
    to hang when the server attempts to perform a clean SSL shutdown. We now call 
    SSL_shutdown() once, even if the shutdown is not complete after the first call.
  - added Poco::Crypto::X509Certificate::save()
  - fixed a bug in Poco::Zip::Decompress that results in wrong paths for extracted files
  - fixed a bug in Poco::Zip::ZipManipulator where the Zip file was opened in text format
    on Windows.
  - added Poco::Crypto::X509Certificate::issuedBy() to verify certificate chain.
  - added methods to extract the contents of specific fields from the 
    subject and issuer distinguished names of a certificate.
  - fixed 0000089: Thread::sleep() on Linux is extremely inaccurate

  - fixed SF# 2465794: HTTPServerRequestImpl memory leak
  - fixed SF# 2583934: Zip: No Unix permissions set
  - the NetSSL_OpenSSL library has been heavily refactored
  - added NumberFormatter::append*() and DateTimeFormatter::append() functions
  - use NumberFormatter::append() and DateTimeFormatter::append() instead of format() where 
    it makes sense to gain some performance
  - added system.dateTime and system.pid to Poco::Util::SystemConfiguration
  - added %F format specifier (fractional seconds/microseconds) to DateTimeFormatter,
    DateTimeParser and PatternFormatter.
  - fixed SF# 2630476: Thread_POSIX::setStackSize() failure with g++ 4.3
  - fixed SF# 2679279: Handling of -- option broken
  - added compile options to reduce memory footprint of statically linked applications 
    by excluding various classes from automatically being linked.
    See the POCO_NO_* macros in Poco/Config.h.
  - fixed SF# 2644940: on Windows the COMPUTER-NAME and the HOSTNAME can be different
  - added DNS::hostName() function	
  - added build configuration for iPhone (using Apple's SDK)
  - basic support for AIX 5.x/xlC 8
  - fixed a bug resulting in a badly formatted exception message with IOException 
    thrown due to a socket-related error
  - fixed SF# 2644718: NetworkInterface name conflict in MinGW
  - added a missing #include to CryptoTransform.h
  - fixed SF# 2635377: HTTPServer::HTTPServer should take AutoPtr<HTTPServerParams>
  - replaced plain pointers with smart pointers in some interfaces
  - upgraded to sqlite 3.6.13
  - improved Data::SQLite error reporting
  - Poco::Glob now works with UTF-8 encoded strings and supports case-insensitive comparison.
    This also fixes SF# 1944831: Glob::glob on windows should be case insensitve
  - added Twitter client sample to Net library
  - Fixed SF# 2513643: Seg fault in Poco::UTF8::toLower on 64-bit Linux
  - Poco::Data::SessionPool: the janitor can be disabled by specifying a zero idle time.
  - added Poco::Data::SessionPool::customizeSession()
  - added support for different SQLite transaction modes (DEFERRED, IMMEDIATE, EXCLUSIVE)
  - fixed a few wrong #if POCO_HAVE_IPv6 in the Net library
  - added support for creating an initialized, but unconnected StreamSocket.
  - added File::isDevice()
  - added family() member function to SocketAddress,
  - Data::SQLite: added support for automatic retries if the database is locked
  - XMLConfiguration is now writable
  - fixed an IPv6 implementation for Windows bug in HostEntry
  - Timer class improvement: interval between callback is no longer influenced by the 
    time needed to execute the callback.
  - added PriorityNotificationQueue and TimedNotificationQueue classes to Foundation. 
    These are variants of the NotificationQueue class that support priority and 
    timestamp-tagged notifications.
  - added Poco::Util::Timer class. This implements a timer that can schedule different 
    tasks at different times, using only one thread.
  - the signatures of Poco::NotificationQueue and Poco::NotificationCenter member functions 
    have been changed to accept a Poco::Notification::Ptr instead of Poco::Notification* 
    to improve exception safety. This change should be transparent and fully backwards 
    compatible. The signature of the methods returning a Poco::Notification* have not been 
    changed for backwards compatibility. It is recommended, that any Notification* obtained 
    should be immediately assigned to a Notification::Ptr.	
  - SQLite::SessionImpl::isTransaction() now uses sqlite3_get_autocommit() to find out 
    about the transaction state.
  - improved SQLite data type mapping
  - refactored Crypto library to make it independent from NetSSL_OpenSSL.
  - added support for RSA-MD5 digital signatures to Crypto library.
  - removed SSLInitializer from NetSSL library (now moved to Crypto library)
  - added build configs for static libraries to Crypto library
  - OpenSSL now depends on Crypto library (which makes more sense than
    vice versa, as it was before). Poco::Net::X509Certificate is now
    a subclass of Poco::Crypto::X509Certificate (adding the verify()
    member function) and the Poco::Net::SSLInitializer class was 
    moved to Poco::Crypto::OpenSSLInitializer.		  
  - added build configs for static libraries to Zip
  - added batch mode to CppUnit::WinTestRunner.
    WinTestRunnerApp supports a batch mode, which runs the
    test using the standard text-based TestRunner from CppUnit.
    To enable batch mode, start the application with the "/b"
    or "/B" command line argument. Optionally, a path to a file
    where the test output will be written to may be given:
    "/b:<path>" or "/B:<path>".
    When run in batch mode, the exit code of the application
    will denote test success (0) or failure (1).
  - testsuites now also work for static builds on Windows
  - The IPv6 support for Windows now basically works (Net library compiled with POCO_HAVE_IPv6)
  - fixed a potential error when shutting down openssl in a statically linked application
  - added static build configs to Data library
  - added Poco::AtomicCounter class, which uses OS-specific APIs for atomic (thread-safe) 
    manipulation of counter values.
  - Poco::RefCountedObject and Poco::SharedPtr now use Poco::AtomicCounter for 
    reference counting
  - fixed SF# 2765569: LoadConfiguration failing from current directory


!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

  - Some methods that have previously taken a plain pointer (to a reference counted object)
    as argument now take a Poco::AutoPtr instead. This shouldn't cause any problems for
    properly written code. Examples are Poco::NotificationCenter, Poco::NotificationQueue
    and Poco::Net::HTTPServer.
  - Poco::Glob now works with and assumes UTF-8 encoded strings.
  - Poco::Timer: the interval between callbacks is no longer influenced by the 
    time needed to execute the callback.
  - The Crypto and NetSSL_OpenSSL libraries have been refactored. NetSSL_OpenSSL
    now depends on the Crypto library (previously, it was vice versa).
  

!!!Release 1.3.3

!!Summary of Changes

  - Threads now have optional user-settable stack size (if the OS supports that feature)
  - Events now support simplified delegate syntax based on delegate function template.
    See Poco::AbstractEvent documentation for new syntax.
  - Cache supports new access expire strategy.
  - Upgraded to SQLite 3.6.2
  - Upgraded to PCRE 7.8
  - added HttpOnly support to Poco::Net::HTTPCookie
  - NetworkInterface now has displayName() member (useful only on Windows)
  - Poco::Util::WinRegistryKey now has a read-only mode
  - Poco::Util::WinRegistryKey::deleteKey() can now recursively delete registry keys
  - Poco::File::created() now returns 0 if the creation date/time is not known, as 
    it's the case on most Unix platforms (including Linux). 
    On FreeBSD and Mac OS X, it returns the real creation time.
  - Time interval based log file rotation (Poco::FileChannel) now works
    correctly. Since there's no reliable and portable way to find out the creation 
    date of a file (Windows has the tunneling "feature", most Unixes don't provide 
    the creation date), the creation/rotation date of the log file is written into 
    the log file as the first line.
  - added Environment::nodeId() for obtaining the Ethernet address of the system
    (this is now also used by UUIDGenerator - the corresponding code from UUIDGenerator
    was moved into Environment)
  - added a release policy argument to SharedPtr template
  - Socket::select() will no longer throw an InvalidArgumentException
    on Windows when called with no sockets at all. If all three socket
    sets are empty, Socket::select() will return 0 immediately.
  - SocketReactor::run() now catches exceptions and reports them via
    the ErrorHandler.
  - SocketReactor has a new IdleNotification, which will be posted when
    the SocketReactor has no sockets to handle.
  - added referenceCount() method to Poco::SharedPtr.
  - POCO now builds with GCC 4.3 (but there are some stupid warnings:
    "suggest parentheses around && within ||".
  - Solution and project files for Visual Studio 2008 are included

  - fixed SF# 1948361: a little bug for win32
  - fixed SF# 1896482: tryReadLock intermittent error
  - workaround for SF# 1959059: Poco::SignalHandler deadlock
    the SignalHandler can now be disabled globally by adding a

!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

The (now deprecated) Poco::HashFunction class template has been changed in an 
incompatible way. The member function formerly named hash() is now the function
call operator. If you have defined your own HashFunction classes,
you have to update your code. Sorry for the inconvenience.

On Windows, POCO now builds with Unicode/UTF-8 support 
(POCO_WIN32_UTF8) enabled by default. If you need the previous (1.2)
behavior, remove the corresponding #define from Poco/Config.h
