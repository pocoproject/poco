POCO Data Release Notes
Data

!!!Release 1.3

Release 1.3 of the POCO C++ Libraries is the first official release containing the Data library.
The Data library has been available in a development state for the 1.2 release. For the 1.3
release, a few things have been changed in an incompatible way that requires changes
to existing code.

!!Summary of Changes

  - Class Poco::Data::RecordSet has been added providing generic access
    to arbitrary tables.
  - SessionInstantiator has been renamed Poco::Data::Connector.
  - Poco::Data::BLOBInputStream and Poco::Data::BLOBOutputStream allow convenient access to Poco::Data::BLOB data.
  - Poco::Data::Session and Poco::Data::Statement can be used in simpler ways.
  - The DataConnectors project directory has been merged into the Data project directory.


!!Incompatible Changes and Possible Transition Issues

SessionInstantiator has been renamed Poco::Data::Connector, and the
member functions addToFactory() and removeFromFactory() are now named
registerConnector() and unregisterConnector(), respectively.
This requires a change in all applications already using POCO Data.
