POrtable COmponents C++ Libraries are:
--------------------------------------
- A collection of C++ class libraries, conceptually similar to the Java Class Library, the .NET Framework or Apple’s Cocoa.
- Focused on solutions to frequently-encountered practical problems.
- Focused on ‘internet-age’ network-centric applications.
- Written in efficient, modern, 100% ANSI/ISO Standard C++.
- Based on and complementing the C++ Standard Library/STL.
- Highly portable and available on many different platforms.
- Open Source, licensed under the [Boost Software License](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSL-1.0).

In regards to Boost, in spite of some functional overlapping,
POCO is best thought of as a Boost complement (rather than replacement).
Side-by-side use of Boost and POCO is a very common occurrence.
