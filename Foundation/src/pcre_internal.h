/* When compiling a DLL for Windows, the exported symbols have to be declared
using some MS magic. I found some useful information on this web page:
http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y4h7bcy6(VS.80).aspx. According to the
information there, using __declspec(dllexport) without "extern" we have a
definition; with "extern" we have a declaration. The settings here override the
setting in pcre.h (which is included below); it defines only PCRE_EXP_DECL,
which is all that is needed for applications (they just import the symbols). We
use:

  PCRE_EXP_DECL       for declarations
  PCRE_EXP_DEFN       for definitions of exported functions
  PCRE_EXP_DATA_DEFN  for definitions of exported variables

The reason for the two DEFN macros is that in non-Windows environments, one
does not want to have "extern" before variable definitions because it leads to
compiler warnings. So we distinguish between functions and variables. In
Windows, the two should always be the same.

The reason for wrapping this in #ifndef PCRE_EXP_DECL is so that pcretest,
which is an application, but needs to import this file in order to "peek" at
internals, can #include pcre.h first to get an application's-eye view.

In principle, people compiling for non-Windows, non-Unix-like (i.e. uncommon,
special-purpose environments) might want to stick other stuff in front of
exported symbols. That's why, in the non-Windows case, we set PCRE_EXP_DEFN and
PCRE_EXP_DATA_DEFN only if they are not already set. */

/* PCRE keeps offsets in its compiled code as 2-byte quantities (always stored
in big-endian order) by default. These are used, for example, to link from the
start of a subpattern to its alternatives and its end. The use of 2 bytes per
offset limits the size of the compiled regex to around 64K, which is big enough
for almost everybody. However, I received a request for an even bigger limit.
For this reason, and also to make the code easier to maintain, the storing and
loading of offsets from the byte string is now handled by the macros that are
defined here.

The macros are controlled by the value of LINK_SIZE. This defaults to 2 in
the config.h file, but can be overridden by using -D on the command line. This
is automated on Unix systems via the "configure" command. */

then run on another where the size of pointers is different, all might still
be well. For the case of compiled-on-4 and run-on-8, we include an extra

originally included - even though you can never get this planning right - but
there is only one left now.

NOTE NOTE NOTE:
Because people can now save and re-use compiled patterns, any additions to this
structure should be made at the end, and something earlier (e.g. a new
flag in the options or one of the dummy fields) should indicate that the new
fields are present. Currently PCRE always sets the dummy fields to zero.
