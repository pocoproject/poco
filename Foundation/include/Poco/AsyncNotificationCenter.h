class Foundation_API AsyncNotificationCenter: public NotificationCenter
	/// AsyncNotificationCenter decouples posting of notifications
	/// from notifying subscribers by calling observers' notification
	/// handler in a dedicated thread.
	///
	/// It supports multiple modes of operation:
	///
	/// - ENQUEUE: Notifications are added to a queue, separate single thread
	///            asynchronously dispatches them to observers sequentially
	///
	/// - NOTIFY: Notifications are added to a list for each observer, multiple
	///           worker threads process notifications in parallel
	///
	/// - BOTH: Combination of both modes, notifications are enqueued and worker
	///         threads dispatch them to observers in parallel.
	///
	/// NOTIFY and BOTH mode:
	///
	/// These modes are only available if the compiler supports C++20 std::jthread.
	///
	/// Notifications can be delivered to observers in a different order than they
	/// were posted, as they are processed by multiple worker threads. Observer
	/// handlers must also be thread-safe as multiple notifications can be dispatched
	/// to the same observer in parallel.
	///
	/// Note about using AsyncObserver
	///
	/// Although it is possible to use them with AsyncNotificationCenter,
	/// it is more efficient to use NObserver.
