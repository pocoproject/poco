class Foundation_API DynamicAny
	/// DynamicAny allows to store data of different types and to convert between these types transparently.
	/// DynamicAny puts forth the best effort to provide intuitive and reasonable conversion semantics and prevent 
	/// unexpected data loss, particularly when performing narrowing or signedness conversions of numeric data types.
	///
	/// Loss of signedness is not allowed for numeric values. This means that if an attempt is made to convert 
	/// the internal value which is a negative signed integer to an unsigned integer type storage, a RangeException is thrown. 
	/// Overflow is not allowed, so if the internal value is a larger number than the target numeric type size can accomodate, 
	/// a RangeException is thrown.
	///
	/// Precision loss, such as in conversion from floating-point types to integers or from double to float on platforms
	/// where they differ in size (provided internal actual value fits in float min/max range), is allowed.
	/// 
	/// String truncation is allowed -- it is possible to convert between string and character when string length is 
	/// greater than 1. An empty string gets converted to the char '\0', a non-empty string is truncated to the first character. 
	///
	/// Bolean conversion are performed as follows:
	///
	/// A string value "false" (not case sensitive) or "0" can be converted to a boolean value false, any other string 
	/// not being false by the above criteria evaluates to true (e.g: "hi" -> true).
	/// Integer 0 values are false, everything else is true.
	/// Floating point values equal to the minimal FP representation on a given platform are false, everything else is true.
	///
	/// A DynamicAny can be created from and converted to a value of any type for which a specialization of 
	/// DynamicAnyHolderImpl is available. For supported types, see DynamicAnyHolder documentation.
