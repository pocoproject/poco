- POCO_WIN32_UTF8: UNICODE #define is no longer required (and no longer
  automatically defined in POCO_WIN32_UTF8 is defined)
- PCRE: upgraded to PCRE version 7.1
- fixed SF# 1682162: Suggestion on thread priority

  (see http://www.appinf.com/poco/wiki/tiki-view_forum_thread.php?comments_parentId=343&forumId=6)
- robustness improvements to ActiveMethod - removed the opportunity for memory leaks in 
  case something goes while invoking the method
- made C library usage more C++-like - use C++ headers (e.g. <cstring>) instead of 
  C ones (<string.h>). Also, use C library functions in std namespace.
- added Unicode and UTF8String for improved Unicode support.
  The Unicode class can be used to obtain the Unicode properties of a character.
  The UTF8 class provides case insensitive comparison and case conversion
  for UTF-8 encoded strings.
- added UnWindows.h header file, replaced all #include <windows.h> with #include "Poco/UnWindows.h".
  See the Poco/UnWindows.h header file for a rationale and explanations.

- File::copyTo(): on Windows, the copy now always has the read-only flag reset, to be consistent
  with other platforms.
- With Microsoft Visual C++, the necessary POCO libraries are now implicitly linked when
  the corresponding header files are included (#pragma comment(lib, "PocoXYZ.lib") is used).
  To disable this, compile POCO with the preprocessor symbol POCO_NO_AUTOMATIC_LIBS #define'd
  (see Poco/Foundation.h and Poco/Config.h).
- The Visual Studio project files for the POCO libraries now include configurations
  for building static libraries.

- fixed SF# 1655170: Poco::Timezone::standardName() problem on WIN32
- fixed SF# 1629095: POCO_WIN32_UTF8 problem
  There is a new function Path::transcode() that can be used to convert a path (or any other string)
  from UTF-8 to the current Windows code page. This string can the be passed as a filename
  to an fstream or fopen(). This function only does the conversion on Windows,
  and only, if POCO_WIN32_UTF8 is defined. Otherwise, it simply returns the unmodified argument.
- fixed SF# 1659607: Probably a bug in Poco::Net::DialogSocket
- HTTPServer network performance improvement: responses that fit into a single network packet
  sent with HTTPServerResponse::sendFile() or the new HTTPServerResponse::sendBuffer() are
  sent in only one packet.
- added HTTPServerResponse::sendBuffer()
- HTTPServer now sends a Bad Request response if it fails to parse the HTTP request header.
- HTTPServer now sends an Internal Server Error response if the request handler throws an
  exception prior to sending a response.- enabled TCP_NODELAY per default on TCPServer/HTTPServer

  (server does not send Connection: close when it reaches connection maximum)
- HTMLForm - POST submission of URL encoded form no longer uses chunked transfer encoding
  (thus improving interoperability with certain web servers)
- integrated Environment.cpp from Main (missing get(var, default))
- added missing AutoPtr include to Util/Application 
  (and using Poco::AutoPtr is no longer necessary for POCO_APP_MAIN macro)
- fixed SF# 1635420: Per Regents of the University of Calfornia letter, 
  remove advertising from BSD licensed parts
- fixed SF# 1633133: MultipartWriter writes superluous CR-LF at beginning

  This means that the previous problems with PropertyFileConfiguration and IniFileConfiguration when referencing other channels are solved.
- improved options handling: better handling of (non) ambiguities.
  If both an option named "help" and one named "helper" is specified, this no longer causes ambiguity errors.
- added check for duplicate option definition
- ThreadPool bugfix: fixed a crash that occurs on Linux multiprocessor machines 
  (caused by an thread unsafe string assignment corrupting the heap...) 
  (SF# 1575315)

  prevents some rare dynamic casts error from occuring when using StrategyCollection with Caches
- improvements to Logger and LoggingConfigurator:
  * added Logger::unsafeGet()
  * added Logger::setProperty(loggerName, propertyName, value)
  * LoggingConfigurator now correctly (re)configures existing Loggers
    (prior to this change, if a Logger named "a.b.c" existed before
    the LoggingConfigurator started its work, and the LoggingConfigurator
    configured a Logger named "a.b", then "a.b.c" would not inherit
    the new configuration).
- improvements to SplitterChannel and EventLogChannel configuration
- improved LoggingRegistry exception messages
- MessageHeader::read() is more liberal with malformed message headers.

Release 1.2.1 (2006-08-29)
==========================

- fixed Config.h header (no more #undefs)

Release 1.2.0 (2006-08-29)
==========================

- DateTime fixes: Julian Day is no longer stored internally. 
  Times (hours, minutes, seconds, ...) are now always taken from an utcValue (if available) and not from the Julian day.
  The Julian day is only used for calculating year, month and day (except when the Julian day is the only thing we have)
  This helps us get rid of rounding errors that the Julian Day arithmetic introduced.- on Windows, UUIDGenerator no longer uses Netbios, but GetAdaptersInfo instead
- The main Makefile now has correct dependencies
- updated poco-doc.pl with latest version by Caleb Epstein
- fixed SF #1542722: InflatingInputStream: buffer error

- added Application::stopOptionsProcessing()
- updated samples
- Util::Application command line handling now supports:
  * argument validation (Option::validator(); see Validator, IntValidator, RegExpValidator)
  * binding of argument values to config properties (Option::binding())
  * callbacks for arguments (Option::callback())
  * checking of required parameters
- changed header file locations:
  Foundation headers are now in Poco (#include "Poco/Foundation.h")
  XML headers are now in Poco/XML, Poco/SAX and Poco/DOM (#include "Poco/XML/XML.h")
  Util headers are now in Poco/Util (#include "Poco/Util/Util.h")
  etc.
  Unfortunately, this change will break existing code. However, fixing the code is
  a matter of a few global search/replace operations and can be done quickly.
  On the plus side, POCO is now a much better citizen when used with other
  libraries.

- added additional test case to HTTPServer test suite- HTMLForm: should now work with request methods other than POST and GET (all non-POST requests are treated the same as GET)
- clarified HTMLForm documentation
- HTMLForm bugfix: uploaded files no longer end up in value; PartHandler is called instead
- NameValueCollection: added get(name, defaultValue)
- added HTTPFormServer sample
- added Foundation::HashTable and SimpleHashTable

- added Buffer template class to Foundation
- added the UnicodeConverter utility class. This is mainly used for Windows Unicode support and probably of little use for anything else.
