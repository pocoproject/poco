class Net_API SocketReactor: public Poco::Runnable
	/// This class, which is part of the Reactor pattern,
	/// implements the "Initiation Dispatcher".
	///
	/// The Reactor pattern has been described in the book
	/// "Pattern Languages of Program Design" by Jim Coplien
	/// and Douglas C. Schmidt (Addison Wesley, 1995).
	///
	/// The Reactor design pattern handles service requests that
	/// are delivered concurrently to an application by one or more
	/// clients. Each service in an application may consist of several
	/// methods and is represented by a separate event handler. The event
	/// handler is responsible for servicing service-specific requests.
	/// The SocketReactor dispatches the event handlers.
	///
	/// Event handlers (any class can be an event handler - there
	/// is no base class for event handlers) can be registered
	/// with the addEventHandler() method and deregistered with
	/// the removeEventHandler() method.
	///
	/// An event handler is always registered for a certain socket,
	/// which is given in the call to addEventHandler(). Any method
	/// of the event handler class can be registered to handle the
	/// event - the only requirement is that the method takes
	/// a pointer to an instance of SocketNotification (or a subclass of it)
	/// as argument.
	///
	/// Once started, the SocketReactor waits for events
	/// on the registered sockets, using PollSet:poll().
	/// If an event is detected, the corresponding event handler
	/// is invoked. There are five event types (and corresponding
	/// notification classes) defined: ReadableNotification, WritableNotification,
	/// ErrorNotification, TimeoutNotification and ShutdownNotification.
	///
	/// The ReadableNotification will be dispatched if a socket becomes
	/// readable. The WritableNotification will be dispatched if a socket
	/// becomes writable. The ErrorNotification will be dispatched if
	/// there is an error condition on a socket.
	///
	/// Timeout/sleep strategy operates as follows:
	///
	/// If the poll timeout expires and no event has occurred, a
	/// TimeoutNotification will be dispatched to all event handlers
	/// registered for it. This is done in the onTimeout() method
	/// which can be overridden by subclasses to perform custom
	/// timeout processing.
	///
	/// By default, the SocketReactor is configured to start sleeping
	/// when the poll timeout is zero and there are no socket events for
	/// a certain amount of time; sleep duration is progressive, up to
	/// the configured limit. This behavior can be disabled through
	/// configuration parameters.
	///
	/// When there are no registered handlers, the SocketRactor sleeps
	/// an incremental amount of milliseconds, up to the sleep limit.
	/// Increment step value and sleep limit are configurable.
	///
	/// Finally, when the SocketReactor is about to shut down (as a result
	/// of stop() being called), it dispatches a ShutdownNotification
	/// to all event handlers. This is done in the onShutdown() method
	/// which can be overridded by subclasses to perform custom
	/// shutdown processing.
	///
	/// The SocketReactor is implemented so that it can run in its own thread.
	/// Moreover, the thread affinity to a CPU core can optionally be set for the
	/// thread on platforms where that functionality is supported and implemented.
	/// It is also possible to run multiple SocketReactors in parallel, as long
	/// as they work on different sockets.
	///
	/// It is safe to call addEventHandler() and removeEventHandler() from another
	/// thread while the SocketReactor is running. Also, it is safe to call
	/// addEventHandler() and removeEventHandler() from event handlers.
	///
	/// SocketReactor uses NotificationCenter to notify observers. When a handler
	/// throws an exception, the NotificationCenter stops notifying the rest of
	/// the observers about that particular event instance and propagates the
	/// exception, which is eventually caught in the SocketReactor::run() method.
	/// This sequence of events is obviously not desirable and it is highly
	/// recommended that handlers wrap the code in try/catch and deal with all
	/// the exceptions internally, lest they disrupt the notification of the peers.
